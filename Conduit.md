### Primordial Creation

---

At 1st level, your knowledge and experience with primordial energy aids you in everyday life. Over the course of a minute, you may create or manipulate Acid, Fire, Ice, Thunder and Lightning for up to an hour in the following ways

-   You may create a small pool of acid to slowly corrode a metal
-   You may set a flammable object on fire

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

The effects end if stopped by normal means, such as putting water on a fire, when you dismiss them, or when an hour has passed. You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your desired effect to the DM as precisely as possible. All effects must fall within the following confines:

-   You cannot effect an area greater then 1 cubic foot
-   It cannot directly effect a creature

### Fighting Style

---

At 1st level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.

-   **Archery:** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
-   **Blind Fighting:** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
-   **Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
-   **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
-   **Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
-   **Thrown Weapon Fighting:** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
-   **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
-   **Unarmed Fighting:** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

### Spellcasting

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use primordial energy to cast spells.

#### Cantrips

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the conduit spell list. You learn additional conduit cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Conduit table.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one conduit cantrip you know with another cantrip from the conduit spell list.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Conduit table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your conduit spells. To cast one of your conduit spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of conduit spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the conduit spell list. When you do so, choose a number of conduit spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your conduit level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level conduit, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd-level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *burning hands*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of conduit spells requires time spent in meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Conduit spells, since your magic draws upon your conection to the primordial forces around you. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Conduit spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

{{text-align:center
**Spell save DC**:: = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier**:: = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
}}

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a *primordial focus* as a spellcasting focus for your conduit spells.


{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or rod made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole from a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.

### Energy Imbuement

---

When you reach 2nd level, you may empower your damage with one of the following “imbuement damage types”: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Thunder. As a bonus action, you may expend a spell slot to activate this power. While Energy Imbuement is active, your weapon attacks deal extra damage once per turn for the next minute. Expending a 1st level spell slot allows you to add your Wisdom modifier to the damage. A 2nd level slot additionally adds 1d4 damage, with an additional d4 for each level above 2nd. If you are incapacitated, your imbuement immediately ends.

### Energy Affinity

---

At 3rd level, you choose an focus to augment your abilities. Choose one of the options detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, 15th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

---

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\
If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Martial Versatility

---

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you may replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to conduits.

### Extra Attack

---

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

### Imbued Defense

---

When you use the Energy Imbuement feature, you may choose an imbuement damage type to gain resistance to for the duration of your Energy Imbuement.

\column

### Borrowed Power

At 11th level you may call upon the power of elementals as an action. Each time you use this ability, choose one of the following. If an ability requires a saving throw, the DC is 8 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency Bonus. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short of long rest before you can use it again.

**Fire.** Gouts of molten lava erupt from your body. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on yourself must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 bludgeoning damage. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half as much damage.

**Earth.** One creature of your choice within 30 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and has the blinded condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

**Water.** You magically shoot water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 6d6 cold damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from you and knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half the cold damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked prone.

**Air.** A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The whirlwind lasts as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature other than you that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. You can move the whirlwind up to 20 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if you lose sight of it.

### Sure Footed

Starting at 14th level, your connection to the earth beneath you is strengthened. While you are standing on solid ground, you cannot be forcefully moved against your will, and you have advantage on saves against being knocked prone. Additionally, you gain tremorsense out to a range of 60 feet.

### Chosen of the Elementals

Atop the hierarchy of elementals lies the Leviathan, Zaratan, Phoenix, and Elder Tempest. At 20th level, each of these legendary creatures recognizes your power, and has granted you a boon. If a boon requires a saving throw, the DC is 8 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency Bonus.

**Leviathan.** As an action, you create a wave of water that extends from a point you can see within 120. The wave is up to 250 feet long, up to 250 feet tall, and up to 50 feet wide. Each hostile creature in the wave must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d12 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. The water spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area and within 250 feet of it, and then it vanishes. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

**Zaratan.** As an action, you conjure a shell of rock. Until the start of your next turn, you are resistant to all damage and are restrained. At the start of your next turn, you regain 8d10 hit points and are no longer restrained. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

**Phoenix.** When you die, your body explodes into a burst of flame. Each hostile creature in a 60-foot-radius around you must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Instead of dying, you are restored to life with half of your hit point maximum. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

**Elder Tempest.** Each hostile creature within 120 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a target's saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also stunned until the end of its next turn. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
