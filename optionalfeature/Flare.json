    "When you take the attack action, you may expend a heat die and use a bonus action to throw a dart of fire at a target you can see within 60 feet of you. The dart is a ranged weapon attack with which you are proficient, and the damage is equal to the number rolled on your heat die plus your Intelligence modifier."
