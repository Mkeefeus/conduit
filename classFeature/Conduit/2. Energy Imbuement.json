    "When you reach 2nd level, you may empower you damage with one of the following “imbuement damage types”: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Thunder. As a bonus action, you may expend a spell slot to activate this power. While Energy Imbuement is active, your weapon attacks deal extra damage once per turn for the next minute. The extra damage is 1d4 for a 1st-level spell slot, 1d6 for 2nd, 1d8 for 3rd, 1d10 for 4th, and 1d12 for 5th. If you are incapacitated, your imbuement immediately ends."
