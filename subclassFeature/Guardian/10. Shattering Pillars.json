    "Starting at 10th level, you can coat enemies in an elemental primer. As an action you can pick a Pillar you can see and cause it to explode. All enemies in a 15-foot-radius of the pillar must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is primed. The next attack against that creature has advantage, and deals an additional {@damage 4d6} damage."
