    "At 17th level, you learn to encase your foes in your Icy Pillars. When you create your Icy Pillars, you can now choose to create them in a creatureâ€™s space. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Spell Save DC. On a failed save, the creature is grappled and restrained as they become encased in your Icy Pillar. A creature may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a successful save the creature is freed and moved to the next closest open space to the pillar."
