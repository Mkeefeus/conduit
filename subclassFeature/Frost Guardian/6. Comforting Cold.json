    "At 6th level, you've adapted to the cold and it doesn't bother you anymore. You gain resistance to cold damage.",
    "Additionally, your Icy Pillars provide protection to your allies, and freeze the ground to hinder your enemies. If an allied creature comes within 10 feet of a pillar, then they gain temp HP equal to your Wisdom modifier. If a creature moves within 10 feet of a pillar, it must make a dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone. When you create a pillar you can choose any number of creatures to be immune to this effect."
