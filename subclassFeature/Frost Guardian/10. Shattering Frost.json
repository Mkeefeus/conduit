    "Starting at 10th level, you can coat enemies in a brittle layer of frost. As an action you can pick an Icy Pillar you can see and cause it to explode. All enemies in a 15-foot-radius of the pillar must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is coated in ice. The next attack against that creature has advantage, and deals an additional 4d6 cold damage. "
