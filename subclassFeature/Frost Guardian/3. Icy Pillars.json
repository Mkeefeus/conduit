    "At 3rd level you learn how to create and shape ice to hinder your foes and assist your allies. You gain an amount of Icy Pillars equal to your prof bonus and regain all uses of them on a long rest and one use on a short rest.",
    "As an action, you can create up to as many pillars as you have available. Pick points you can see within 60 feet of you to create the Icy Pillars. Each pillar can be either 5 ft tall and 10 ft wide or 10 ft tall and 5 ft wide. The pillars all have HP equal to 5 times your level in this class and an AC of 14. The pillars last for up to a minute, after which they melt harmlessly into the ground.",
    "If an enemy starts their turn within 5 ft of a pillar then their movement speed is reduced by 10 ft until the end of their turn."
