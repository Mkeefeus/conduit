    "At 15th level, you may use your action to create a massive electrical discharge. All creatures within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your Spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 lightning damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again."
