    "Beginning at 6th level, your excess energy improves your reflexes. You have advantage on initiative checks.",
    "Additionally, when a hostile creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you, you may use your reaction to move up to your movement speed without provoking attacks of opportunity, and make a weapon attack against the attacking creature. You may react in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a short or long rest."
