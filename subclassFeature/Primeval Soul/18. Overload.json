    "At 18th level you gain the ability to consume your energy and create a powerful blast. As an action you create a 60ft radius sphere centered on yourself and select an imbuement damage type. Any hostile creatures within the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes {@damage 24d6 + 40} damage of the selected type, or half that damage on a successful save. Afterwards, you can't move or take actions until after your next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over you."
